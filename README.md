# Santander & Dio Full-Stack Final Project

That's Done!

This project, both front and back-end were done during the last code project for Santander Bootcamp.

It's a Meeting Room organizer, with some sort of elegant integration.

Front-End was entirely made in Angular, using some basic understanding throughout the course.
Back-End came with Java, and was unsurprisingly easy with Java (with a 3/4 part done by Spring Framework)
